### Hello World

Hi! This is my first post on my new website, and also the first website I've ever made with **code**.

This really is a big distraction project for me while I procrastinate on bug fixes for an app I plan to launch within the next week but it was fun to make so who cares.

My plan for this site is to make ite like a 90s era blog but without the heavy use of colour and MDMA.

A notepad where I can write some thoughts, stories and maybe something that is worth more than its weight in bandwidth.

### Tech

This website is built with [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) v2. It uses [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) for a CSS in JS solution. All these posts are written in **markdown** which means I can do...

```javascript
function whatCanMarkdownDo() {
  return 'Cool shit like this';
}
```
